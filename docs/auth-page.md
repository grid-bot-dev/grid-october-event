###  1: Project Overview and Authentication

### 1. Project Name and Heading

**Project Name:** Asset 360
**Logo:** AppstoreOutlined icon
**Tagline:** "Empowering data-driven decisions through comprehensive customer understanding"

### 2. Google SSO Authentication Interface

The Asset 360 platform will implement Google SSO (Single Sign-On) for user authentication, providing a secure and seamless login experience. The authentication process will follow these steps:

1. **Login Button:** Users will see a "Sign in with Google" button on the login page.

2. **OAuth 2.0 Flow:** Upon clicking, the application initiates the OAuth 2.0 flow:
   - Redirect to Google's authentication page
   - User grants permissions
   - Google returns an authorization code

3. **Token Exchange:** The backend exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens.

4. **User Profile Retrieval:** Using the access token, the application fetches the user's Google profile.

5. **Account Linking:** The backend checks if the Google account is linked to an existing Asset 360 account. If not, it creates a new account.

6. **Session Creation:** A session is created, and the user is redirected to the dashboard.

Error Handling:
- Network errors: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Invalid credentials: Clear error message with option to retry
- Account linking issues: Redirect to a resolution page

Security Considerations:
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement CSRF protection
- Store tokens securely (encrypted in the database, not in local storage)
- Set short expiration times for access tokens

UI Design:
- Minimalist login page with Asset 360 logo and tagline
- Prominent "Sign in with Google" button using Google's official button design
- Loading spinner during authentication process
- Clear error messages in case of failure
- Smooth transition to dashboard upon successful login

By leveraging Google SSO, Asset 360 ensures a secure, user-friendly authentication process that aligns with modern web standards and user expectations.
