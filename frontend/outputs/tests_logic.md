# This file contains the generated unit tests logic

File: october_event/frontend/src/main.jsx
Logic: Thank you for providing the code for the main.jsx file. I'll analyze this React script and provide unit test logic based on the given instructions.

<unit tests logic>
Analysis of the Provided React Script (main.jsx):

Function Purpose:
This script is the entry point of the React application. It renders the main App component within a StrictMode wrapper using React 18's createRoot API.

** Unit Testing Requirements: **

While this file doesn't contain complex logic that requires extensive unit testing, we can still test some aspects to ensure the application initializes correctly.

1. Why It Needs Testing:
   - Application initialization: It's crucial to ensure that the main component (App) is rendered correctly.
   - React StrictMode usage: Verify that StrictMode is properly implemented.

2. Test Case Definition:
   * Input Parameters:
     - None directly, as this is the entry point of the application.
   * Expected Outputs:
     - The App component should be rendered within a StrictMode wrapper.
   * Edge Cases and Error Conditions:
     - Test what happens if the 'root' element is not found in the DOM.

3. Clarify Function Interactions:
   - This script interacts with the DOM to find the 'root' element.
   - It imports and renders the App component.
   - It uses React's StrictMode for additional checks and warnings during development.

4. Test Coverage:
   - Statements: Ensure all import statements are executed.
   - Branches: Test the case where 'root' element exists and when it doesn't.
   - Lines: Cover all lines in the file.
   - Functions: Test the rendering function (implicit in createRoot().render()).

Proposed Unit Tests:

1. Test successful rendering:
   - Mock document.getElementById to return a valid element.
   - Mock React's createRoot and its render method.
   - Verify that createRoot is called with the correct element.
   - Verify that render is called with the correct JSX (App wrapped in StrictMode).

2. Test error handling when 'root' element is not found:
   - Mock document.getElementById to return null.
   - Verify that an error is thrown or handled appropriately.

3. Test correct import and usage of components:
   - Verify that App component is imported correctly.
   - Ensure StrictMode is used to wrap the App component.

4. Test CSS import:
   - Verify that the index.css file is imported (though the actual styling can't be unit tested here).

Note: Since this file mainly sets up the React application, most of the actual functionality testing will occur in the App component and its children. The tests for main.jsx are more about ensuring correct initialization and error handling.

File: october_event/frontend/src/App.jsx
Logic: Thank you for providing the React script for the App component. I'll analyze the code and provide unit test logic based on the given instructions.

<unit tests logic>
Analysis of the Provided React Script (App Component/App.jsx):

Function Purpose:
The `App` component is the main component of the application that sets up the routing configuration using React Router. It defines the routes for different pages and renders the `RouterProvider` component to handle navigation.

** Unit Testing Requirements: **

App Component (App.jsx)
1. Why It Needs Testing:
   - Logic complexity: While the component itself doesn't have complex logic, it's crucial to ensure that the routing configuration is correct.
   - User interactions: The routing affects how users navigate through the application, so it's important to verify that the correct components are rendered for each route.

2. Test Case Definition:
   * Input Parameters:
     - No direct input parameters, as the component doesn't take any props.
   * Expected Outputs:
     - The component should render the `RouterProvider` with the correct router configuration.
     - Each route should lead to the correct component or navigation action.
   * Edge Cases and Error Conditions:
     - Test navigation to non-existent routes to ensure proper error handling or redirection.

3. Clarify Function Interactions:
   - The `App` component interacts with the React Router library and the imported page components (Auth, Dashboard, CDPTransformations, UserFlow).

4. Test Coverage for App:
   - Statements: Test the creation of the router and rendering of the RouterProvider.
   - Branches: There are no explicit branches in this component.
   - Lines: Ensure all lines related to route configuration and RouterProvider rendering are executed.
   - Functions: Test the App function itself.

Detailed Test Cases:

1. Test Router Configuration:
   - Verify that the `createBrowserRouter` function is called with the correct routes array.
   - Check that each route in the array has the correct path and element properties.

2. Test Default Route Redirection:
   - Ensure that navigating to the root path ("/") redirects to the "/login" route.

3. Test Individual Route Rendering:
   - For each defined route ("/login", "/dashboard", "/cdp-transformation", "/userflow"), verify that the correct component is rendered when navigating to that route.

4. Test RouterProvider Rendering:
   - Ensure that the RouterProvider component is rendered with the correct router prop.

5. Test Non-existent Route Handling:
   - Navigate to a non-existent route and verify the behavior (e.g., rendering a 404 page or redirecting to a default route).

6. Test Component Imports:
   - Verify that all required components (Auth, Dashboard, CDPTransformations, UserFlow) are correctly imported and used in the route configuration.

Implementation Notes:
- Use a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library to implement these tests.
- Mock the React Router components and functions (createBrowserRouter, Navigate, RouterProvider) to isolate the App component's logic.
- Use memory router for testing to simulate different routes without actually changing the URL.
- Mock the imported page components (Auth, Dashboard, CDPTransformations, UserFlow) to focus on testing the routing logic rather than the content of these components.

Example Test Structure:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

// Mock the page components
jest.mock('./pages/Auth', () => () => <div>Auth Component</div>);
jest.mock('./pages/Dashboard', () => () => <div>Dashboard Component</div>);
jest.mock('./pages/CDPTransformations', () => () => <div>CDP Transformations Component</div>);
jest.mock('./pages/UserFlow', () => () => <div>User Flow Component</div>);

describe('App Component', () => {
  test('renders RouterProvider', () => {
    render(<App />);
    // Add assertions to check if RouterProvider is rendered
  });

  test('redirects root path to login', () => {
    render(
      <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>
        <App />
      </MemoryRouter>
    );
    // Add assertions to check if redirected to login page
  });

  test('renders Auth component for /login route', () => {
    render(
      <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/login']}>
        <App />
      </MemoryRouter>
    );
    expect(screen.getByText('Auth Component')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // Add similar tests for other routes (dashboard, cdp-transformation, userflow)

  test('handles non-existent route', () => {
    render(
      <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/non-existent']}>
        <App />
      </MemoryRouter>
    );
    // Add assertions for non-existent route behavior
  });
});
```

This test structure covers the main functionality of the App component, ensuring that the routing configuration is correct and that the appropriate components are rendered for each route.

File: october_event/frontend/src/pages/CDPTransformations.jsx
Logic: Based on the provided React script for the CDPTransformations component, I'll analyze the functions that require unit tests and outline how to effectively test them considering the business context.

1. Identify Functions:

The main functions/components that require unit testing are:
a. SankeyDiagram (main component)
b. MermaidDiagram (sub-component)
c. toggleCollapsed (function within SankeyDiagram)

2. Unit Testing Requirements:

a. SankeyDiagram Component:
   - Why it needs testing: This is the main component that renders the CDP architecture visualization. It contains complex logic for rendering the Sankey diagram, handling user interactions, and managing the sidebar state.

b. MermaidDiagram Component:
   - Why it needs testing: This component is responsible for rendering the database schema using Mermaid. It's crucial to ensure that the Mermaid diagram is initialized and rendered correctly.

c. toggleCollapsed Function:
   - Why it needs testing: This function handles the collapsing and expanding of the sidebar, which is an important user interaction feature.

3. Test Case Definition:

a. SankeyDiagram Component:

Input Parameters:
- No direct input parameters, but we need to mock the react-router-dom's useNavigate hook.

Expected Outputs:
- The component should render without errors.
- The Sankey diagram should be properly initialized and displayed.
- The sidebar should be rendered with the correct menu items.
- The header should display the correct title.

Edge Cases and Error Conditions:
- Test behavior when Plotly fails to load or initialize.
- Test behavior when the window is resized.
- Test behavior when hovering over different nodes in the Sankey diagram.

b. MermaidDiagram Component:

Input Parameters:
- mermaidCode: A string containing the Mermaid diagram code.

Expected Outputs:
- The component should render without errors.
- The Mermaid diagram should be properly initialized and displayed.

Edge Cases and Error Conditions:
- Test with invalid Mermaid code.
- Test with an empty string as input.

c. toggleCollapsed Function:

Input Parameters:
- No direct input parameters, but it relies on the current state of 'collapsed'.

Expected Outputs:
- The 'collapsed' state should be toggled (true to false, or false to true).
- The sidebar should visually reflect the new collapsed state.

Edge Cases and Error Conditions:
- Test multiple rapid toggles to ensure state consistency.

4. Clarify Function Interactions:

- The SankeyDiagram component uses the MermaidDiagram component to render the database schema.
- The toggleCollapsed function is called when the user clicks the collapse/expand button in the header.
- The SankeyDiagram component interacts with the Plotly library to render the Sankey diagram and handle hover events.

5. Test Coverage:

a. SankeyDiagram Component:
- Statements: Test rendering of all major elements (Sankey diagram, sidebar, header, content).
- Branches: Test collapsed and expanded states of the sidebar.
- Lines: Ensure all useEffect hooks are triggered and Plotly interactions are tested.
- Functions: Test navigation functions for menu items.

b. MermaidDiagram Component:
- Statements: Test the rendering of the Mermaid diagram.
- Branches: N/A (no conditional logic in this component).
- Lines: Ensure the useEffect hook is triggered and Mermaid is initialized.
- Functions: N/A (no additional functions in this component).

c. toggleCollapsed Function:
- Statements: Test the state change of 'collapsed'.
- Branches: Test both true-to-false and false-to-true transitions.
- Lines: Ensure the entire function is executed.
- Functions: N/A (this is a single function).

To implement these tests, you would need to use a testing framework like Jest along with a library for testing React components such as React Testing Library or Enzyme. You would also need to mock external dependencies like Plotly, Mermaid, and react-router-dom's useNavigate hook to isolate the components for unit testing.
