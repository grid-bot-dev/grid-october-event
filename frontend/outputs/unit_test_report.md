# Unit Tests Report

## Unit Tests for `UserFlow.test.jsx`

### Unit Test Case 1: `renders without crashing`
- **Description**: Tests if the WebsiteFlow component renders without any errors.
- **Input**: WebsiteFlow component wrapped in MemoryRouter
- **Expected Output**: Component should render without throwing any errors
- **Actual Output**: Error - Element type is invalid
- **Status**: Failed
- **Error**: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
- **Reason**: The test failed due to an issue with the component import or export. The WebsiteFlow component is likely not exported correctly from its file.

### Unit Test Case 2: `renders the correct title`
- **Description**: Verifies if the WebsiteFlow component displays the correct title.
- **Input**: WebsiteFlow component wrapped in MemoryRouter
- **Expected Output**: Title "CDP - Website Flow" should be present in the rendered component
- **Actual Output**: Error - Element type is invalid
- **Status**: Failed
- **Error**: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
- **Reason**: The test failed due to the same issue as the first test case. The component could not be rendered to check for the title.

### Unit Test Case 3: `renders the menu items`
- **Description**: Checks if the WebsiteFlow component renders the expected menu items.
- **Input**: WebsiteFlow component wrapped in MemoryRouter
- **Expected Output**: Menu items "Dashboard", "Analytics", and "User Flow" should be present
- **Actual Output**: Error - Element type is invalid
- **Status**: Failed
- **Error**: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
- **Reason**: The test failed due to the same component rendering issue as the previous test cases.

### Unit Test Case 4: `renders the MermaidDiagram component`
- **Description**: Tests if the WebsiteFlow component renders the MermaidDiagram component.
- **Input**: WebsiteFlow component wrapped in MemoryRouter
- **Expected Output**: MermaidDiagram component should be present in the rendered output
- **Actual Output**: Error - Element type is invalid
- **Status**: Failed
- **Error**: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
- **Reason**: The test failed due to the same component rendering issue as the other test cases.

## Unit Tests for `main.test.jsx`

### Unit Test Case 5: `should render App component wrapped in StrictMode`
- **Description**: Verifies if the main entry point renders the App component wrapped in StrictMode.
- **Input**: Execution of main.jsx
- **Expected Output**: App component should be rendered and wrapped in StrictMode
- **Actual Output**: Test passed successfully
- **Status**: Passed
- **Error**: None
- **Reason**: The main entry point correctly renders the App component wrapped in StrictMode as expected.

## Unit Tests for `App.test.jsx`

### Unit Test Case 6: `renders without crashing`
- **Description**: Checks if the App component renders without any errors.
- **Input**: App component
- **Expected Output**: Component should render without throwing any errors
- **Actual Output**: Test passed successfully
- **Status**: Passed
- **Error**: None
- **Reason**: The App component rendered without any issues as expected.

# Recommendations
1. Review and fix the export of the WebsiteFlow component. It appears that the component is not being exported correctly, causing rendering issues in the tests.
2. After fixing the component export, re-run the tests to ensure they pass and provide accurate coverage information.
3. Increase the overall test coverage, particularly for functions, which currently have a low coverage of 14.28%.
4. Add more test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases for each component.
5. Consider adding error boundary tests to handle potential rendering errors in the components.
