# Customer Data Platform (CDP) Application Design Document

## Page 1: Project Overview and Authentication

### Project Name: Unified Customer Insights Platform

**Tagline:** Empowering data-driven decisions through comprehensive customer understanding.

### Google SSO Authentication

The Unified Customer Insights Platform will implement Google Single Sign-On (SSO) for secure and seamless user authentication. This approach aligns with best practices discussed by our DevOps team, emphasizing security and user experience.

#### Authentication Process:
1. Users initiate login via a prominent "Sign in with Google" button on the login page.
2. The application redirects to Google's OAuth 2.0 server.
3. Users authenticate with their Google credentials.
4. Upon successful authentication, Google returns an authorization code.
5. The backend exchanges this code for access and refresh tokens.
6. The application creates or updates the user session, storing necessary information securely.

#### Error Handling:
- Implement graceful error handling for network issues, invalid credentials, or server errors.
- Display user-friendly error messages with clear next steps.
- Log detailed error information for backend analysis and troubleshooting.

#### Security Considerations:
- Use HTTPS for all communications to ensure data encryption in transit.
- Implement token rotation and secure storage of refresh tokens.
- Set appropriate token expiration times and implement automatic token refresh.
- Use state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks during the OAuth flow.

#### Authentication Interface Design:
- Minimalist login page with the CDP logo and tagline.
- Prominent "Sign in with Google" button using Google's official button design guidelines.
- Brief explanation of the benefits of using Google SSO (e.g., enhanced security, convenience).
- Loading indicator during the authentication process.
- Clear visual feedback upon successful login or errors.

By leveraging Google SSO, we ensure a secure, user-friendly authentication process that aligns with modern security practices and reduces the friction of account management for our users.

## Page 2: Dashboard Design and Components

### Dashboard Layout and Structure

The dashboard will utilize a responsive 12-column grid system to ensure optimal display across various device sizes. This approach aligns with the UI Developer's emphasis on flexibility and customization.

#### Navigation Design:
- Top horizontal navigation bar with the CDP logo, user profile, and main menu items.
- Left sidebar for detailed navigation, collapsible on smaller screens.
- Main content area occupying the central and right portions of the screen.

#### Screen Real Estate Allocation:
- Header: 10% of vertical space
- Left sidebar (when expanded): 20% of horizontal space
- Main content area: 80% of horizontal space (100% when sidebar is collapsed)
- Individual components will be sized relative to the main content area

### Dashboard Interactivity and User Experience

- Global date range filter affecting all components
- Search functionality for finding specific customers or products
- Cross-component data linking (e.g., clicking a segment in the Customer Segment chart filters other components)
- Customizable dashboard layout with drag-and-drop widget positioning
- User preference saving for layout and default filters

## Page 3: Architecture Visualization and Technical Considerations

### Sankey Diagram Implementation

The Sankey diagram will be implemented to visualize the data flow in our CDP, based on the provided diagram structure.

#### Data Flow Representation:
- Source nodes: `customer_info`, `purchase_transactions`, `product_catalog`, `customer_service`, `campaign_responses`, `marketing_campaigns`, `website_behavior`
- Intermediate nodes: `temp_basic_info`, `temp_purchase_stats`, `temp_product_preferences`, `temp_customer_service_stats`, `temp_campaign_engagement`, `temp_website_behavior`
- Target node: `customer_360`

#### Styling Guidelines:
- Use a color scheme that distinguishes between source, intermediate, and target nodes
- Adjust link thickness based on data volume or importance
- Implement smooth curves for links to enhance visual appeal

#### Interactivity Features:
- Hover over nodes or links to highlight the connected paths
- Click on nodes to expand/collapse and show more detailed information
- Implement zooming and panning for exploring large diagrams
- Provide tooltips with data summaries when hovering over nodes or links

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Use a JavaScript library like D3.js for rendering the Sankey diagram
2. Create a data structure that represents nodes and links
3. Implement the layout algorithm to position nodes and calculate link paths
4. Add interactivity using event listeners (mouseover, click, etc.)
5. Implement responsive design to adjust diagram size based on screen dimensions

### Data Integration and Performance

- Implement efficient data loading using pagination and lazy loading techniques
- Utilize client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates on critical metrics
- Use IndexedDB for offline data storage and faster subsequent loads
- Implement error boundaries and fallback UI components for robustness

### Responsive Design and Cross-platform Considerations

- Define breakpoints: Desktop (1200px+), Tablet (768px-1199px), Mobile (<768px)
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile users (e.g., larger touch targets)
- Use progressive enhancement to add features based on device capabilities
- Optimize data visualization components for various screen sizes

## Page 4: Website Flow and API Integration

### Website Flow

1. User arrives at the login page and authenticates via Google SSO
2. Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to the main dashboard
3. Dashboard initializes by loading essential components (KPIs, Customer Segments)
4. Additional components load asynchronously to improve perceived performance
5. User can interact with various components, triggering API calls as needed
6. Navigation between different sections (e.g., detailed customer profiles) is handled via client-side routing

### API Integration

The dashboard integrates with backend APIs for each component:

```json
{
  "kpis": "/kpis",
  "customer_segments": "/customer_segments",
  "monthly_revenue": "/monthly_revenue",
  "top_customers": "/top_customers",
  "product_category_performance": "/product_category_performance",
  "customer_satisfaction": "/customer_satisfaction",
  "churn_risk": "/churn_risk",
  "rfm_segmentation": "/rfm_segmentation"
}
```

Each API call will include necessary parameters (e.g., date ranges, filters) and handle pagination where applicable. Error handling will include retry logic for transient failures and graceful degradation for component-specific issues.

### Data Refresh and Real-time Updates

- Implement a combination of polling and WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Use an event-driven architecture to propagate changes across components
- Implement optimistic UI updates for improved perceived performance
- Handle data conflicts through version control or timestamp-based resolution
- Provide visual indicators for data freshness and ongoing update processes

By following this comprehensive design document, UI developers will have a clear roadmap for implementing a robust, user-friendly, and data-rich CDP application that leverages the full potential of the provided schema and aligns with the insights shared in the development team discussions.
